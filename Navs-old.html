            <h3>Peter Pan <small>Chief Epicurious Officer</small></h3>
                        <p>
                            Our CEO, Peter, credits his hardworking East Asian immigrant parents who undertook the
                            arduous journey to the shores of America with the intention of giving their children the
                            best future. His mother's wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the tastiest dishes with
                            whatever is available inexpensively at the supermarket, was his first inspiration to create
                            the fusion cuisines for which <em>The Frying Pan</em> became well known. He brings his zeal
                            for fusion cuisines to this restaurant, pioneering cross-cultural culinary connections.

                        <p>
                            Our CFO, Danny, as he is affectionately referred to by his colleagues, comes from a long
                            established family tradition in farming and produce. His experiences growing up on a farm in
                            the Australian outback gave him great appreciation for varieties of food sources. As he puts
                            it in his own words, <em>Everything that runs, wins, and everything that stays, pays!</em>
                        </p>

                            Blessed with the most discerning gustatory sense, Agumbe, our CTO, personally ensures that
                            every dish that we serve meets his exacting tastes. Our chefs dread the tongue lashing that
                            ensues if their dish does not meet his exacting standards. He lives by his motto, <em>You
                            click only if you survive my lick.</em>
